TF2Hack
=======

Simple Team Fortress 2 Hack.
I didn't bother to reverse any of the updated interfaces, so pretty much the only thing that's working as of now (Dec. 25 2013, Merry Christmas!) is IEngineCvar interface.
Not the best practice in coding with a lot of copy & paste code, it's pretty much uploaded here as a proof-of-concept.
